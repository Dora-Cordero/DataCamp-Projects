DataCamp is an online learning platform that offers interactive courses and tutorials in the field of data science. It provides a plethora of resources designed to help learners develop and enhance their skills in data analysis, programming, and statistical modeling using different programming languages such as Python, SQL, and R, amongst others. 

This repository contains the various projects I've completed either as part of a competition (during or after) or simply as an elaboration upon any of the briefs in the "projects" or "datasets" sections, in order to continously put into practice what I learn. The main languages utilized are Python and SQL; each folder contains a report (with code) along with the associated dataset(s).

Please feel free to drop a comment, provide feedback, or ask any questions about work. It is only by sharing knowledge that one can grow! ðŸŒ±
